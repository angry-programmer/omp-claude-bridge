`omp-claude-bridge` lets you drive **Claude Code** — Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, and Fable — from inside Oh My Pi, with every tool call flowing through OMP's native TUI. It also exposes an **AskClaude** tool so any other provider can delegate a task or a second opinion to Claude Code, and it gives you **direct control over the context window** each model requests.

Authentication and billing run through Claude Code and your Anthropic subscription via the official [Claude Agent SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript) — this extension never stores credentials.

## Features

- **Claude Code as a provider** — pick Opus / Sonnet / Haiku / Fable from `/model`; tool calls render in OMP's TUI like any native provider.
- **AskClaude delegation tool** — from any other provider, hand a task or question to Claude Code (read-only, no-tools, or full read/write/bash), optionally in an isolated session.
- **Switchable context window** — force **1M** or **200K** globally, or leave it on measured per-model defaults. This is the headline addition in this fork.
- **Session resume & persistence** — conversations survive across turns and reconnects.
- **Skills + AGENTS.md forwarding** — your OMP skills and context files are passed into Claude Code's system prompt.
- **Thinking support** — effort levels map through to Claude Code, including `xhigh` on Sonnet models.
- **MCP tool bridging** with strict-config isolation by default.

## Install

```bash
omp plugin install git:github.com/DevVig/omp-claude-bridge
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods</summary>

```bash
# From the full HTTPS URL
omp plugin install https://github.com/DevVig/omp-claude-bridge

# From a local checkout (great for hacking on it)
git clone https://github.com/DevVig/omp-claude-bridge.git
omp plugin install ./omp-claude-bridge
```

</details>

Requires Oh My Pi (`omp`) and a working Claude Code login.

## Quickstart

1. Install the plugin (above).
2. In OMP, run `/model` and choose a `claude-bridge/*` model — for example `claude-bridge/claude-sonnet-5`.
3. Work as usual. Tool calls run through OMP's TUI; Claude Code handles the model turn.

To delegate from another provider instead, just ask: *"Ask Claude to review this plan and poke holes in it."*

## Context window controls

When `provider.models` is a non-empty explicit list, Claude Code serves
different context windows depending on the exact model id it receives (e.g.
bare `claude-fable-5` serves 200K, while `claude-fable-5[1m]` serves 1M).
That static fallback exposes supported windows as separate `/model` entries:

- `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-8` → **Opus 4.8 (1M)**
- `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-8-200k` → **Opus 4.8 (200K)**

Switching window is just picking the other entry — no config edit, no reload. Every model appears once per window it supports, the `(1M)` / `(200K)` label is always shown, and each entry reports its true window so OMP's status bar and auto-compaction threshold stay accurate.
With runtime SDK discovery, entries are never invented or expanded: each SDK
`value` is registered exactly once, and only a value that includes `[1m]`
receives 1M metadata.

### Default window

The **unsuffixed** id (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`) maps to a default window; the other window gets a `-1m` / `-200k` suffixed id. `provider.contextWindow` in `~/.omp/agent/claude-bridge.json` picks that default — it no longer hides models, it only decides which window is unsuffixed:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "contextWindow": "auto"
  }
}
```

| Mode | Default (unsuffixed) window |
| ---- | -------- |
| `"auto"` *(default)* | Per-model measured default. Respects `plan` and `longContextExtraUsage`. |
| `"1m"` | 1M where the model has a 1M runtime, else its only window. |
| `"200k"` | 200K where the model has a 200K runtime, else its only window. |

Both windows stay in the picker regardless of this setting (wherever a runtime exists); it only changes which one is the plain, unsuffixed id. So `modelRoles` / `enabledModels` that reference `claude-bridge/claude-opus-4-8` keep working and follow the default.

### Windows offered per model

| Model | 200K entry | 1M entry | `auto` default |
| ----- | :--------: | :------: | :------------: |
| `claude-opus-4-8` | ✓ | ✓ | 1M |
| `claude-opus-4-7` | — | ✓ | 1M |
| `claude-opus-4-6` | ✓ | ✓ | 200K¹ |
| `claude-fable-5` | ✓ | ✓ | 200K |
| `claude-sonnet-5` | ✓ | ✓ | 1M |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | ✓ | ✓ | 200K² |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | ✓ | — | 200K |

¹ Opus 4.6's `auto` default is 1M when `plan: "max"` or `longContextExtraUsage: true`.
² Sonnet 4.6's `auto` default is 1M when `longContextExtraUsage: true`.

The suffixed alternate exists only for the window that isn't the default — e.g. under `auto` you get `claude-opus-4-8` (1M) + `claude-opus-4-8-200k`, and under `"200k"` you get `claude-opus-4-8` (200K) + `claude-opus-4-8-1m`.

> Forcing 1M is a *request*: some models may still be **served** 200K by your subscription entitlement. Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` to log the served window (see [Debugging](#debugging)).

> An invalid `contextWindow` value logs a warning and falls back to `"auto"`, so a typo never breaks startup.

## Models

The `/model` picker is populated from Claude Code's official Agent SDK
`supportedModels()` catalog at runtime. The SDK's `value` is kept verbatim as
the picker id and as the id sent to Claude Code, so aliases such as `default`,
`sonnet`, `opus`, and `haiku` do not get rewritten to a stale hardcoded
version. Display names and effort support come from the SDK; cost, input,
context, and output metadata are enriched from the best matching pi-ai entry.
Duplicate SDK values are ignored after their first occurrence.

For example, a current Claude Code catalog may expose `default`, `sonnet`,
`claude-fable-5-1[1m]`, `opus`, and `haiku`; a future SDK model appears
automatically after OMP refreshes its dynamic catalog. `[1m]` values retain
their exact id and 1M context metadata.

If you need a deliberately static catalog, set `provider.models` to a
non-empty list of exact Claude Code ids. That explicit list bypasses discovery
and retains the legacy context-window variant behavior:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "models": ["claude-opus-4-8", "claude-sonnet-5"]
  }
}
```

Discovery failures are surfaced to OMP so its last good dynamic catalog can be
preserved. On a cold cache, fix the Claude Code executable/configuration or use
an explicit static list; the bridge never invents a selectable runtime.
Bash commands issued by Claude Code get a 120-second default timeout (matching Claude Code's default), since OMP's bash has no timeout by default.

## AskClaude tool

Available whenever the active provider is **not** claude-bridge. Your current model can hand work to Claude Code and wait for the result:

- "Ask Claude to plan a fix."
- "If you get stuck, ask Claude for help."
- "Ask Claude to review the plan in @foo.md, implement it, then ask an `isolated=true` Claude to review the implementation."
- "Ask Claude to poke holes in this theory."
- "Find all the places in the codebase that handle auth."

You can also bake it into a skill or AGENTS.md, e.g. *"Always call AskClaude to review complicated feature implementations before considering the task complete."*

### Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `prompt` | string | The question or task for Claude Code. |
| `mode` | `read` (default), `none`, `full` | `read` = read files + web; `full` = read/write/bash. Lock `full` out with `allowFullMode: false`. |
| `model` | `opus` (default), `sonnet`, `haiku`, or a full id | Dynamic SDK aliases and exact values are passed directly to Claude Code; an alias not in the current catalog is still sent unchanged. |
| `thinking` | `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` | Effort level. |
| `isolated` | boolean (default `false`) | When `true`, Claude gets a clean session with no conversation history. |

## Configuration reference

Config is read from `~/.omp/agent/claude-bridge.json` (global) and the project OMP config directory `.omp/claude-bridge.json` (project; merged over global). A starter file lives at [`claude-bridge.example.json`](claude-bridge.example.json).

```json
{
  "askClaude": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowFullMode": true,
    "defaultIsolated": false
  },
  "provider": {
    "contextWindow": "auto",
    "plan": "pro",
    "longContextExtraUsage": false,
    "strictMcpConfig": true
  }
}
```

**`askClaude`**

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Register the AskClaude tool. |
| `name` | `"AskClaude"` | Override the tool's OMP-side name. |
| `label` | `"Ask Claude Code"` | Override the TUI label. |
| `description` | — | Override the tool description shown to the model. |
| `defaultMode` | `"read"` | `"read"`, `"none"`, or `"full"`. |
| `defaultIsolated` | `false` | Start each call in a fresh session. |
| `allowFullMode` | `true` | Allow `mode: "full"`; set `false` to lock it out. |
| `appendSkills` | `true` | Forward OMP's skills block into the system prompt. |

**`provider`**

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| `models` | — | Non-empty exact-id list that opts out of runtime discovery and uses the static fallback path. |
| `contextWindow` | `"auto"` | `"auto"`, `"1m"`, or `"200k"` for the static fallback path. Dynamic entries retain only windows evidenced by SDK values. |
| `plan` | `"pro"` | Set to `"max"` to enable Opus 4.6 at 1M in the static fallback path. |
| `longContextExtraUsage` | `false` | Opt into metered 1M usage for static legacy model ids. |
| `appendSystemPrompt` | `true` | Append OMP's AGENTS.md and skills. |
| `settingSources` | — | Claude Code filesystem settings to load; also used during SDK model discovery. |
| `strictMcpConfig` | `true` | Block MCP servers from `~/.claude.json` / `.mcp.json`. Cloud MCP is always blocked. |
| `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` | — | Path to the `claude` binary, used for both discovery and requests. |

## How it works

OMP's built-in tools are bridged to Claude Code and back, so from your side it behaves like any other OMP provider. With no explicit `provider.models`, registration uses OMP's `fetchDynamicModels` hook; the hook runs an initialization-only Agent SDK query and OMP stores the successful catalog in its SQLite cache for 24 hours. The bridge projects SDK values without renaming them, and only the explicit static configuration uses the legacy context-window expansion in [`src/models.ts`](src/models.ts).

## Debugging

Set `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` for detailed logs:

- **Bridge log** — `~/.omp/agent/claude-bridge.log`: every provider call, session-sync decision, tool-result delivery, and Claude Code stderr. Override the path with `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG_PATH`.
- **Per-query CLI logs** — `~/.omp/agent/cc-cli-logs/<timestamp>-<tag>-<seq>.log`: the Claude Code subprocess's own debug stream, one file per query. Tags are `provider`, `continuation`, or `askclaude`.

When filing a session-resume bug (e.g. "No conversation found"), the `syncResult:` lines from the bridge log plus the matching `cc-cli-logs/` file are the most useful attachments.
